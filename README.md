**Median Calculation Model (TensorFlow Lite)**

This repository contains a TensorFlow model that calculates the median of a dynamic set of latitude-longitude coordinates and converts it into a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model for efficient inference on edge devices.

**Features**

Dynamic Input Support: Accepts any number of coordinate pairs (N, 2).

Efficient Median Calculation: Uses TensorFlow operations to compute the median correctly for both odd and even input sizes.

TFLite Conversion: Converts the model into a .tflite file for lightweight deployment.

**Requirements**

Before running the script, install the required dependencies:

pip install tensorflow

**Usage**

Running the Script

To generate the TFLite model, run:

python geo_fencing.py

This will create a median_model.tflite file in the current directory.

**TensorFlow Model Overview**

The model 

Accepts a (N, 2) input representing latitude-longitude pairs.

Sorts the input values.

Computes the median, handling both even and odd cases.

Converts and saves the model in the .tflite format.

**Expected Output**

After running the script, you should see:

 TFLite model successfully created: median_model.tflite

**Deployment**

You can use the generated median_model.tflite in TensorFlow Lite-supported environments, such as Android, Raspberry Pi, or embedded systems, for efficient median calculation.
